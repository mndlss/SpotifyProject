# SpotifyProject
## Overview
The core idea was to analyze a dataset of songs, extracting key auditory features. By clustering songs with similar characteristics, I created a foundation for recommending tracks that align with a user's musical taste.
## Methodology
### 1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing ->
- Collected a comprehensive dataset encompassing various genres and artists.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
### 2. Clustering ->
- Utilized clustering algorithms to group songs with similar auditory profiles.
- Identified distinct musical clusters representing diverse genres and styles.
## Outputs Achieved
-	Data pre-processing operations.
- As a part of data analysis and visualizations I drew all the possible plots to provide essential informations and to derive some meaningful insights.
- It also shows the correlation matrix of features according to the datasets.
- Found out and have plot different clusters according to different parameters.
- Build your model and show your final result so that the recommendation system can be built based on that.
- Built a model to show the final result on which the recommendation system can be built.
